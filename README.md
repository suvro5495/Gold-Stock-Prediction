# Gold-Stock-Prediction 

##📈 Gold Price Prediction Project 📉  
   
    Predicting gold prices accurately is crucial for investors and traders looking to make 
    informed decisions in the ever-changing financial markets.
   
    🌟 Leveraging machine learning techniques, this project aims to forecast gold prices using historical data, 
        enabling stakeholders to anticipate market trends and optimize their investment strategies. 💰

##🔍 Project Overview 🔍

    The project utilizes a comprehensive dataset spanning from January 19, 2014, to January 22, 2024, sourced from Nasdaq. 
    This dataset encompasses key financial metrics for each trading day, including opening and closing prices, 
    trading volume, as well as the highest and lowest prices recorded during the day. 📊

##🎯 Project Objectives 🎯

    1. Time Series Analysis: Explore historical trends and patterns in gold prices.
    2. Advanced Modeling: Develop predictive models to forecast future gold prices.
    3. Trading Strategy Development: Formulate and backtest trading strategies based on price and volume information.
    4. Statistical Analysis: Conduct statistical tests and analyses to gain insights into gold price movements.

##🔬 Key Findings and Insights 🔬

    a. Data Exploration: The dataset revealed cyclical patterns and seasonality in gold prices, 
       with noticeable trends and fluctuations over the years. 📈
    b. Predictive Modeling: A Linear Regression model achieved an accuracy of 90% on the test set, 
       while an LSTM model demonstrated an accuracy of 95%. 
       These models provide valuable insights into future gold price trends. 💡
    c. Trading Strategy Insights: A reverse trading strategy based on Bollinger Bands showed potential for generating profits, 
       with a notable Sharpe ratio and positive total return. 💼
